          Jane is a very quick learner and quickly grasps key concepts of Web development. 
          She got a great attitude & she is an excellent team player. 
          She has a curious mind and asks the right question. 
          She takes initiative within a team and has potentials to lead the team.

          Working with Jane has been an awesome experience. 
          She is highly knowledgable and always goes the extra step to make sure everything is right. 
          For any future projects that need her expertise I would definitely want to work with her again.

          I had worked along with Jane during the initial phase of our venture which needed Web development. 
          She is a committed resource who has in depth knowledge about the domain. 
          She will be an asset for any organisation!

            Zyril edits videos really well. She can set the mood of a video with ease. I was struggling to find a super creative and highly dependable video editor before so I'm so glad that I found her! Hire her if you want to have videos that either kicks ass or makes you weep.

        She really is the best Technical Support out there! Navigating these digital devices can get confusing sometimes but with someone as helpful as her, you will learn how to use your device while she guides you. Very knowledgeable and has outstanding customer service skills! Highly recommended!

        Filmmaking is all about passion. Nowadays it's very hard to find a filmmaker who purely just wants to tell a story and that's who Zyril B is. She really has a vision for her films and is able to effectively communicate it with the whole crew! The output is always great so I will always work with any of her films in a heartbeat!
